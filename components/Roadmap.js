We are pretty much confident just like all other meteorite enthusiasts all over the world that we have nothing other than real â€˜Meteorites'. In order to support our statements, we will be doing a scientific test done by a scientist and showcase our reports online on our webpage and social media channels. Be it Meteorite or not, we will keep going forward and realise our wild visions for the future.
