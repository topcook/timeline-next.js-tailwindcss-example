                                Along with its potential utilities and DAO properties, we expect massive
                                adoption world-wide. We will aim to list our $token at a tier 1 exchange
                                for the launch. We are aiming to build a virtual university fully powered
                                by our DAO $token where we offer education for literally free of cost for
                                anyone who hold our $token worth pennies at any market condition.                        </div>
